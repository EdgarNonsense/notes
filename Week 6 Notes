Inheritance is the mechanism for deriving new classes from existing ones
 * Parent - Child
 * superclass - subclass
Forms an is relationship

Every object in python uses inheritance, 
all classe are derived from the base class object

to create inheritance from one class to another, 
  * create your superclass, create your subclass, addp arenthese to the class name, and inside the parentheses put the superclass name
  * all built in and data types can be extended

any attributes or methods can be overriden
in a subclass, give an attribute or method the same name as the element in the sublclass

A subclass that inherits from more than one parent
  * access attributesand method from both
  
  to fix diamond problem, use super()
  super is designed to help with complicated multiple inheritances
  
  Polymorphism is
  * Different behaviors happen depending on the subclass used
  * Inheritance can then be used to simplify the design
  * Details are encapsulated
  
 Inheritance is the most important reason to use polymorphism
 a correct interface becomes interchangable
 
 special error objects that we use when an error needs to be handled
 
 all exceptions come from the BaseException
  *Basexception is a superclass
  * all the other exception are subclasses and extend the functionality
  
  use the term raise, with the class of the exception you want to raise
  
  Handling exceptions are done using Try/except
  
  If none of the built-ion exceptions meets your need, just build your own.
