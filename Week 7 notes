Containers are used to  store collections of data

Built in collection examples
  1.) Lists
  2.) Dictionaries
  3.) Tuples
 Collection modules are used to improve the functionality of the built in collection containers
 
 Every subclass is based on object
 if we instantiate directly we cannot add attributes or meory.
 can create empty class objects
 
 immutable collection objects stored comma seperated
 Can be unpacked by setting equal numbers of variables to a tuple
 
 Named tuples are useful for
  1.) Knowing the attributes and values in read only format
  2.) Need to keep attributes grouped together
  3.) Do not need to add behavior to an object
  4.)ideal for data only representations
  
Dictionaries are extremely useful mutable container that uses key/value pairs to map objects to other objects
defaultdict avoids the need to make sure all keys are in your dictionary
Counters takes instances of iterable elements & count each instance
List allows you to collect elements of same type

Two ways of sorting a list
  -variable.sort()
  -sorted(variable)
  
 sets are from math, an unordered collection of unique elements
 Design patterns are the standard blueprints of software engineering
 Any one design pattern proposes a set of objects interacting in a specific way to solve a general problem
 
 To understand a design pattern, you need to understand the abstract base class (ABCs)
 To create an ABC, you only define the methods without an implementation
 
 The Iterator is an abstract base class (ABC) from the collections.abc module
 defines the iterator protocal used by all loops
 
 Dispatch tables are pointers to functions or methods
 Call the dictionary and pass any parameters
