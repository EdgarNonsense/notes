Stakcs are a data structure organized like a stack of plates.
the last item added to the stack is the first removed from the stack
stack operations includes: pop push and peek

stacks are used for tracking return address in function call, and passing data into functions

push - used to add an element to the top of the stack
pop - used to remove an element from the top of a stack
peek - used to return to the top element from the stack

queues are a special type of list data structure,
it is first in, first out, there are no strict rules for queues.

Initialization sets an items variable to an empty list
methods add and rmeove elements at index 0
enqueuue adds elements at index 0
dequeue removes elements at index 0

stack based queues are used to show push and pop
two lists will show what is currrently in the list
then on pop it will show the order of the elements exiting the list

printers have a queue for the printer job
OS have a queue for CPU procressing
Media Players have a queue for playlist

Hashing is a way to convert data from an arbitrary size into data of a fixed size.

numerical value represents the conveted data types, and are used with dictionares to conver the keys into a value used with a traditional array

perfect hasing is where a data structure being converted is guaranteed to be unique
collisions happen when two data structres have the same values

a hast table is a form of a list of elements access by keyword rather than an index number
dictionary is a form of a hash table
can be any structure that forms key value pairs

strings are easy to convert into keys for hash tables
for non-string keys, you will need to make modificiations

original hash table class had a hard coded size
slots will fill up so it will need to grow

need to calculat the load factor then increase as it approaches to 1

chaining is a strategy to resolve conflicts and avoid the limit to number elements in a hash table
rather than ptting none in the slots, use an empty list
- each slot can hold multiple items
- avoids conflicts by allowing multiple elements to have the same hash value
