** Recursion **
Computers are made up of hardwares and algorithms are what make the hardwares useful
Algorithms:
  -Process or rules to be followed with a finite sequence
  –Well-defined instructions used by computers to solve problems
  –Mathematically oriented process for problem solving
Alogrithms help programmsers think about certain problems, and help us learn to isolate components of a problem, define relationships between compoenents.

Algorithms are essential for ocmputer science and intelligent systems, as well as many other things. It also plays a key role in technological innovations, it also improves problem solving and analytical thinkings

Key elements of Algorithm include
  1.) Sequiential Operations
  2.) Actions bbased on the state of a data structure
  3.) Iteration, repeating an action a number times
  4.) Recursion, calling itself on a subset of inputs
 
 Algorithm Desigh Paradigms:
  1.) Divide and conquer
    - Breaks a problem into smaller problems, combines the results into a solution
  2.) Greedy Algorithms
    - Optimizing for the shortest pth to a solution
  3.) Dynamic Prgoramming
    - Useful when sub problems overlap, results are ached & used later
    
What is recurion?
  1.) A function that calls itself is recursive
  2.) the process of calling itself is called recursion
  
What does recursion require?
  - Minimum of 1 arguement for testing the base case
  - Minimum of 1 decision to continue or exit the recursion

Factorials are a mathematical operation used in many areas,
  - It is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n
  - it is denoted as n!
  A use is to count distinct sequences of distinct n! object, known as permutations
  
 Recursion and iteration are similar since recursion is a special case of iteration called a tail iteartion, for and while loops are also iterations, and both recursion and iteration requrire a selection statement to end.
 Recursion and Iteration differ as recursion repeatedly calls a function while iterations go through a sequence of operations
 
 Recursion have limits, the module sys can tell you the limits of the recursion and help you increase the limit.
 
 Different designs of recursion include
  1.) Backtracking - Good for problems where you must choose options
    - Depending on the choices made, it would reach the end goal or backtrack to a previous node
  2.) Divide and Conquer - Consist of Dividing the Problem, Solving the subproblems, and combining the solution
