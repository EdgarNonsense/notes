Algorithms are just steps and processes that form a program, classification shcemese are based off the goals of the algorithm
Major modes of classification include
  - Classification by Implementation
  - classification by Complexity
  - Classification by Design
  
Classification by Implmentation inclused
  - Recursion: algorithm that calls itself till a condition is satisfied
  - Logical: algorithm with controlled logical deduction
    - Logic component determines meaning; control affects efficiency
    â€“ Expressed as algorithm = logic + control
  - Serial: algorithm executed sequentially 1 instruction at a time
  - Parallel: algorithm that performs > 1 operation at a time
  - Deterministic: produces the same result every time
  - Nondeterministic: can change the order of execution to get a new result each time
  
Classification by Complexisty is determined by the memory space and time used in computation
Classification by design includes 
- Dynamic Programming: Divide a problem into smaller sub problems 
- Divide and Conquer: Problem-solving emphasizes the need to break down a problem into smaller problems
- Greedy Algorithms: make decisions that yield the largest benefit in the interim

P-type is a class of problems computer solve
NP-type is a harder class of problems that computer olve

A problem is NP-Hard if all other problem in NP can be polynomial time reducible or mapped to it
A problem is NP-complete problem if the NP is hard and found in NP class
