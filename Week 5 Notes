Names for classes havbe the same rules as variables
  * Must start with a letter or underscore
  * can have letters, numbers, and underscores
  
Classes should by named with CapWords notation where each word starts with a capital
creating a class needs the keyword **class**
follow it by a name and a colon

Class have attributes, methods, initializer, constructor and indentation.

Attributes can be added anytime during initialization and after an object have been initialized
<object>.<attribute> = <value>

In python, everything is public unless made private

Invoking actions is done via a method,
method is identical to functions where you use def and take parameters inside the parentheses.
Required to have an instance parameter called self.

The self argument references the instance of an object
 * Required to access attributes & methods inside a specific object
 * Ties the class to the instance so operations performed only affect the specific object
 * Variables that do not start with self, are normal local variables
Object-oriented programming is about interaction
Methods can affect attributes and  interact with each other.
There's a difference between methods and functions
  * methods require 1 argument and functions don't
 dot notation does not have to pass self when calling methods
 
Python has both constructor and initializer
they're treated differently by the interpreter
 
Initializer are used to call methods from the class and set attributes
Constructor is not commmonly used, but must return the newly created object, and used to create meta classes

Method is a function attached to a class
self paramter is a specific instance of that class
when you call on two different objectm you're calling the same method but different objects.

Used modules with dot notation
<module>.<element>
can specify specific class or function 
<element>
all elements imported use a specific name 

dont imort all classes and functions into a local namespace

package is a collection of modules in a folder
the name of the folder is the name of the pacakge
