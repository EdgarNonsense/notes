Trees are Hiearchical form of data structure
 - has a parent child relationship between items
 used for
 - parsing expressions
 -searches
 -documents like xml

**Terminology of Trees**
Node: any structure that holds data
Root Node: node from which all other nodes come from
Sub-Tree: a tree with its nodes as a descendant of another tree
Degree: the number of sub-trees of a given node
Leaf Node: node with a degree of 0
Edge: connection between two nodes
Parent: a node in the tree with other connecting nodes
Child: a node connected to a parent
Sibling: all nodes with the same parent
Level: the number of connection from the root node
Height: number of levels in a tree
Depth: number of edges from the root to a node

a tree structure is build out of nodes
and it forms a parent child relationships

binary trees is one in which each node has only 2 children maximum, and each child is identified as left or right of parent
nodes are structured to allow for efficient search
Insert and remove operation is required to make binary search usable.
method to find the minimum and maximum nodes
method to search the tree

traversal means to visit all the nodes in a tree
- can be done depth first or breadth first
depth first means following the edge to the limit before going up
breadth first means start at the root and viist each level completely before moving to the next level

binary search tree reduces the number of comparison to find a value
